# AviatoApp

While modern aviation can bring us to the farthest corners of the Earth in a short period of time, we know that flying is also a stressful experience. Aviato is an Android app that helps users make the most of their time by helping them get to the airport only when they really need to. Just enter your flight number and we will show you how to get to your destination on time and, most importantly, stress-free. 

Aviato gathers information from [beacons](http://www.sita.aero/innovation/sita-lab/ibeacons) that are available in airports aroudn the world to calculate the estimated waiting time at each different station at those airports. By giving that information to users, they are able to plan their trip better. This app was one of the finalists at Singapore Airlines' [AppChallenge 2015](http://appchallenge.singaporeair.com/).
